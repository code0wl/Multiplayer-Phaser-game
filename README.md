# Multiplayer Phaser Game

[Phaser 3](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) is out and [Phaser 4](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser4) is in the works. This project is based on [Phaser CE](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce). Due to the ever changing nature of the Phaser projects, keeping up with the changes might mean a complete rewrite every 4-5 months. The structure and patterns would stay in place, but the major changes come from the Phaser api changes.

I will be writing a book on Phaser 4 in the near future as soon as it's stable, and thus initially skipping Phaser 3 altogether.

## Use great technologies

Such as TypeScript, Phaser and socket.io to create a fun little multi-player
game that can entertain you and your friends for a minute or two.

You will learn to animate sprites, work with physics, and develop logic to
create a modern multi-player spaceship shooter!

Once you have forked or downloaded this repository you can start it with the following command

## How to run a preview

```bash
npm start
```

## Known issues

1. Currently when a ship gets destroyed, the window just refreshes with `location.reload()`. Updating this code with `location.reload(true)` will fix the issue where the reload causes just a black screen to appear. This forces the browser to reload all assets instead of partially reloading them, which in turn fixes the bug. This branch includes the fix, but in the book the issue is still there.
2. "Listing 4-16. src/client/controls/keyboard.model.ts" should be "src/client/controls/keyboard.class.ts"
3. "Listing 5-2 player.class.ts" should be "game.class.ts"

## Multiplayer functionality

If you are running on a local server on your computer, opening a second browser window and visiting the same `localhost` port (3000) will simulate the multi-player functionality.

## Issues

For any issues regarding NPM. Most of the fixes require you to remove the `package-lock.json` file and reinstalling the dependencies with `npm i`. The NPM/Node community is extremely fragile.

No project is without issues. Since this is associated with a printed book. The book sadly cannot fix any encountered issues. If encountered. Please mention the issues associated with this [github repo](https://github.com/code0wl/Multiplayer-Phaser-game/issues). I will then drop anything I am doing to assist as best I can! Thank you for your support and for giving me the opportunity to write something for you.

## Special Thanks

@csajedi who has helped identify the listing issues in the book. The PDF will be updated accordingly.
